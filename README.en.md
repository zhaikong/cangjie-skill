# Cangjie Skill

Distill a book into a set of executable AI skills.

## Why This Exists

There's a recent viral idea: distilling colleagues into AI skills. Even after someone leaves, their experience, tone, and work style can be partially replicated by AI. [nuwa-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/nuwa-skill) does exactly this — creating "human skills" like an Elon Musk skill or a Warren Buffett skill. The companion [darwin-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/darwin-skill) handles automatic skill evolution.

Distilling people is valuable — nuwa-skill has already proven this. Distilling what people have **written** is a complementary dimension: a book represents years of deliberate thinking — the distilled essence of careful reflection. Rather than imitating someone's expression style, extracting their systematically produced methodologies into tools that help people solve real problems is equally valuable.

There's also a real pain point: you might read many books but struggle to apply them. Knowledge stays at the "I've read it" level and never gets activated in real decisions. Once a book is distilled into skills, an AI agent can invoke that knowledge in real scenarios — instead of letting it gather dust in your notes.

So cangjie-skill has one clear goal: **distill every book worth distilling**, turning each high-value book into a set of independently callable, composable, and pressure-testable AI skill packs.

## What Problems It Solves

- Reading many books but never applying them — knowledge stays at "I've read it" and never activates in real decisions
- Book summaries and reading notes are compression, not structured reuse — you still don't know "when to use what"
- Only a small fraction of a book deserves to become a tool — strict filtering is needed, not wholesale inclusion
- Existing reading methodologies are designed for human readers, not agent executors — distillation must be execution-oriented, not reading-oriented

## How It Works

cangjie-skill uses the **RIA-TV++** pipeline to transform a book from raw text into a set of structured skills. The process has six stages:

1. **Whole-Book Comprehension (Adler Analysis)** — Structural, interpretive, critical, and applicability analysis using Mortimer Adler's method, producing `BOOK_OVERVIEW.md`
2. **Parallel Extraction** — Five specialized extractors (frameworks, principles, cases, counter-examples, glossary) run simultaneously to pull candidate units from the source text
3. **Triple Verification** — Each candidate must pass three checks: at least 2 independent supporting passages (cross-domain), ability to answer a novel question (predictive power), and non-commonsense uniqueness. Pass rate is typically 25-50%
4. **RIA++ Construction** — Verified content is structured into six dimensions: R (original quote) / I (own-words reconstruction) / A1 (book cases) / A2 (future trigger scenarios) / E (executable steps) / B (boundaries & blind spots)
5. **Zettelkasten Linking** — Dependency, contrast, and composition relationships between skills are identified, producing `INDEX.md` with a reference graph
6. **Pressure Testing** — Test prompts including bait questions are designed for each skill; failures go back for full reconstruction

The name RIA-TV++ breaks down as:
- **RIA**: From Zhao Zhou's bookmark method (Reading / Interpretation / Appropriation)
- **TV**: Triple Verification
- **++**: Agent-oriented extensions — E (Execution) + B (Boundary)

## Effect Examples

### Example 1: From a Book to a Skill Pack

**User Need**

"I want to turn a book's core methodologies into reusable AI skills, not just a reading summary."

**How cangjie-skill reasons**

- Check whether the source material has reusable methodological units
- Distinguish what deserves to be a standalone skill vs. background material
- Output a structured skill repository, not a single summary document

**Example Output**

> The result will not be one summary document. It will be a multi-skill repository with `BOOK_OVERVIEW.md`, `INDEX.md`, multiple `*/SKILL.md` files, and `test-prompts.json` for trigger testing.

### Example 2: Structured Reuse, Not Compression

**User Need**

"I don't want a long explanatory article. I want a skill pack my agent can reuse."

**How cangjie-skill reasons**

- Target is structured reuse, not narrative compression
- Prioritize triggerable, composable, testable skill units
- Reject material that doesn't deserve standalone skill status

**Example Output**

> The system produces multiple skill modules with trigger conditions, boundaries, execution patterns, and related-skill links — rather than flattening the source into one generalized note.
